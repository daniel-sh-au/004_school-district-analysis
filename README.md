# Module 4: PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview of the School District Analysis

### Summary
Due to the presence of academic disloyalty, the math and reading scores of ninth graders at Thomas High School must be considered null. The purpose of this analysis was to remove the scores for ninth graders in Thomas High School while keeping the other scores untouched. Then, the school district analysis was repeated to observe the changes on the analysis.
